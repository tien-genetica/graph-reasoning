0,"**Background:** Currently, there are no disease-modifying pharmacological treatment options for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The hallmark of DLB is pathological alpha-synuclein (aS) deposition. There are growing amounts of data suggesting that reduced aS clearance is caused by failure in endolysosomal and autophagic pathways, as well as glucocerebrosidase (GCase) dysfunction and mutations in the GCase gene (GBA). Population studies demonstrated that the incidence of GBA mutations is higher",cec2628c48074cbeb55c4d106ee14d64
1,"that the incidence of GBA mutations is higher among Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, and carriers of such mutations have a higher risk of developing PD. The incidence of GBA mutations is even higher in DLB, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) confirmed the correlation between GBA mutations and DLB. In vivo experiments have shown that ambroxol (ABX) may increase GCase activity and GCase levels and therefore enhance aS autophagy-lysosome degradation pathways. Moreover, there is an",38d7ac2f9f054974a2e35123ee3bd298
2,"degradation pathways. Moreover, there is an emerging hypothesis that ABX may have an effect as a DLB modifying drug. The aims of the study “Ambroxol in new and early Dementia with Lewy Bodies (ANeED)” are to investigate the tolerability, safety, and effects of ABX in patients with DLB.",be3044184cfa41b3879a826ed83df54b
3,"**Methods:** This is a multicentre, phase IIa, double-blinded, randomised, and placebo-controlled clinical trial, using a parallel arm design for 18 months’ follow-up. The allocation ratio is 1:1 (treatment:placebo). Participants must fulfil the following inclusion criteria: a) diagnosis of possible or probable DLB or MCI-DLB according to the established McKeith criteria, b) age between 50 and 85 years, c) MMSE score > 15 at screening, d) stable doses of antiparkinsonian or dementia medications",82b3c1fa81d54c2293caa92ec7492023
4,"doses of antiparkinsonian or dementia medications for at least 1 month prior to study initiation, e) informed consent capability, and f) a responsible caregiver who has contact with the participant at least three times a week. The main exclusion criteria include clinically significant or unstable psychiatric, medical, or surgical conditions, major cardiovascular or cerebral events within 6 months prior to the first visit, advanced malign disease, and known sensitivity to ABX.",a55eeeea608f450d9345da5c3d3ca956
5,"**Discussion:** The ANeED study is an ongoing clinical drug trial with ABX. The unique, but not fully understood mechanism of ABX on the enhancement of lysosomal aS clearance may be promising as a possible modifying treatment in DLB. The rationale for the use of ABX in DLB is firmly established and is based on both preclinical and clinical data. Because GCase activity is associated with aS metabolism, enhancing chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) may potentially reduce pathological aS",e85e7c453a154750ac5fceda136f3519
6,(CMA) may potentially reduce pathological aS depositions. Preclinical trials of ABX in models of synucleinopathies are promising and show effects of reducing the concentration of toxic aS species. ABX penetrates into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and first trials have shown an enhancing effect of ABX on GCase activity in human cells.,0e6a5fb74e774691be7718baddcdf40d
7,"**Conclusion:** Our study is the largest ongoing clinical trial with ABX and the first in patients with prodromal and mild DLB. We hope that our study will bring more knowledge about ABX’s safety, tolerability, and efficacy in the drug treatment of synucleinopathies, such as DLB. We also hope that treatment will show effects on both clinical outcome measures and digital and traditional CSF biomarkers.",85e95b22143c4820b04e37c16c0f604d
