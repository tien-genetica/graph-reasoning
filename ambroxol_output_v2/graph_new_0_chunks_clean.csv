1,"Gaucher disease, the inherited deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the gene GBA1, which is also the most frequent genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease. While the development of small-molecule stabilizers of glucocerebrosidase is being considered for both disorders, discovery and optimization of lead compounds is limited by the lack of robust cell-based assays amenable to high-throughput screening format. We developed a comprehensive",e6c37fd7b9734096b7a545e2dc728b2b
2,"assay pipeline for preclinical discovery of glucocerebrosidase modulators and began by screening libraries enriched with bioactive compounds with known mechanisms of action. The screen identified small molecules with established relevance to glucocerebrosidase, provided an atlas of potential new molecular targets regulating the GBA1 pathway, and produced a set of promising potential therapeutics.",3946a6404b2b4560a27cd78b8474a899
3,**Introduction**,10afa8d0b52143648c29e82dd9311a71
4,"Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is implicated in both a rare, monogenic disorder (Gaucher disease, GD) and a common, multifactorial condition (Parkinson’s disease, PD); hence, it is an urgent therapeutic target. To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag,",9739d55bef1f4e19b77d1fc84bdb9f7f
5,"enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT-GBA1 transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in GBA1-knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure–activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive",e35825b1f65f4127a808fcf0ef92d448
6,"collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and noninhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: The fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 directly visualized GCase",ba3bf95efaea4452975aea144a764402
7,"lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of small molecules targeting GCase,",c9c51ec400c44aafaed1197affee365f

10,"The HiBiT reporter is an 11-amino acid peptide tag suitable for luminescence-based qHTS. To explore the feasibility of tagging human GCase at its N terminus with HiBiT, prior to generating stable cell lines, we transiently transfected cells with constructs encoding a transgene containing the GBA1 signal peptide, the HiBiT peptide tag, and a Gly/Ser linker upstream of GBA1. The transgene was expressed in a GBA1-KO H4 (human neuroglioma) cell line, and localization of the reporter protein was",f50ebb05e4b24517bf3cf4f176ae098b
11,"assessed using a monoclonal human GCase antibody, hGCase-1/23. When moderately expressed, HiBiT-GCase-WT showed specific lysosomal localization comparable to endogenous GCase and transfected untagged GCase, suggesting that the HiBiT tag did not interfere with GCase trafficking. However, higher levels of untagged GCase led to ER accumulation without clear lysosomal localization, indicating that GCase trafficking is perturbed by overexpression. To address this, HiBiT-GCase-WT expression was",552c921bbe58430bba62fc716149ea1b
12,"constrained by integrating the transgene cassette into a safe-harbor site within an intron of the Citrate Lyase Beta-Like (CLYBL) gene using transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in the GBA1-KO H4 cell line. This integrative gene transfer method allows efficient knock-in of the large transgene, with minimal impact on local and global gene expression. Sustained expression of the transgene is driven by a strong CAG promoter. A GBA1-KO H4 clone with a single copy of",30743621907743c18a3ac935f6b15c79

15,"The HiBiT peptide reporter tag preserves trafficking and function of labeled GCase variants, providing a cell-based platform for qHTS. The HiBiT- GCase H4 lines were tested in ultrahigh-throughput (1,536-well plate) format and showed selective stabilization of HiBiT-GCase-L444P with a dose-dependent response. The primary screen identified 716 compounds (6.6%) as hits, with 140 confirmed in follow-up testing. The final hits represented several mechanisms of action, including epigenetic",1c5675f4fb034241aaeb0e95567374fd

17,**Discussion**,d9a068b1fde144b8be1d9ae12c164f0a
18,"A major challenge in the field of small-molecule GCase enhancers is the lack of adequate cell-based assays amenable to HTS format which can drive the identification, pharmacological validation, and stepwise medicinal chemistry optimization of new chemical matter. To enable rational development of GCase enhancers as a therapeutic strategy, we leveraged an integrated approach, using basic science knowledge surrounding the GBA1 molecular target to inform the design of physiologically relevant,",92745fc73fe94b628d4d8ad3859e2297
19,"translational assays that can accelerate the drug discovery process. The results indicate that an N-terminal HiBiT tag has negligible influence on GCase maturation, trafficking, and function. Our findings underscore the reliability of the HiBiT-GCase-L444P assay, its ability to detect both PCs and PRs, and its utility as a workhorse for lead discovery and development.",58ba000eb1f74acbaf3fb5b74133f5f8
20,**Conclusion**,c2e70deee6c2442cb169e8dcb53c2a61
21,"In conclusion, we integrated basic science knowledge surrounding the GBA1 target with translational expertise to construct a multilevel drug discovery pipeline for GD and GBA1-PD. Our approach identified small molecules that increase GCase-L444P protein levels, lysosomal activity, and lysosomal translocation. These include a PR with a novel mechanism of action, pladienolide B, and an improved derivative of an existing PC, NCGC326. Both reversed GluSph accumulation in the H4 model. Finally, we",bf3a1236649540429951c4a914dbbb3f
22,"used a combinatorial matrix screening approach to identify synergistic actions of PRs with a PC in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. The hits identified in this screen and validated in orthogonal assays should be prioritized for further investigation, with the goal of providing a potent and efficacious therapeutic for patients with neuronopathic GD, GBA1-PD, or other diseases associated with GCase activity defects.",2772668019984017a983a48b60d06f93
