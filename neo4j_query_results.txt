In an attempt to upgrade the level of evidence and thereby of international trust in Ambroxol, particularly for nGD and GBA1-PD, we have established an investigator- initiated drug registry which originally included 41 patients, receiving a daily dose between 75 and 1485 mg (median 435 mg, which is roughly three times the daily dose when used as a cough medicine) that is followed for a period of 1 to 76 months (median 19 months; [27]), and we are currently updating this report to include over 150 patients, with a longer follow- up and a higher mean dose of Ambroxol. Currently there are 4 on-going clinical trials with high-dose Ambroxol at different doses with different study designs (out of 14 active Phase 1â€“3 trials evaluating drug therapies for GBA1-PD registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, as of 31 January 2024), yet none of them is an FDA-guided trial which will open the door for the commercialization of Ambroxol for the two indications mentioned above [20]. While early data seem promising regarding the potential of Ambroxol to favorably impact the course of GBA1-PD [3,10,27], this drugâ€”like any other pharmacological chap- eron that may be developed for this indicationâ€”is unlikely to be equally effective for all different variants, as different mutations can lead to distinct folding defects or stability issues of the mutant misfolded proteins [28]. An earlier stage to the conduction of clinical trials is obviously the need to identify those individuals who are either at risk or have already developed GBA1-related PD.
